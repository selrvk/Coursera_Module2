            <h3>Chicken</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Chicken is a versatile and lean source of protein that is enjoyed globally in countless cuisines. It can be roasted, fried, grilled, or boiled, and is often chosen as a healthier alternative to red meat. With its mild flavor, chicken adapts well to spices and marinades, making it a favorite in dishes ranging from curries and soups to salads and sandwiches. It provides essential nutrients such as protein, selenium, and B vitamins.

        <p>
            Beef is meat that comes from cattle and is one of the most widely consumed sources of protein in the world. It can be prepared in many ways, from grilling and roasting to stewing and stir-frying. Different cuts of beef, such as ribeye, sirloin, and brisket, offer distinct flavors and textures. It is rich in protein, iron, and vitamin B12, making it a staple in many diets, though it should be consumed in moderation due to its saturated fat content.

        <h3>Sushi</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that combines vinegared rice with a variety of ingredients, including raw or cooked fish, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes egg. It comes in different forms such as nigiri (slices of fish over rice), maki (rolled in seaweed), and sashimi (raw fish without rice). Sushi is often accompanied by soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger, balancing flavors of freshness and umami. Known for being light yet flavorful, sushi is not only a cultural delicacy but also a healthy option rich in omega-3 fatty acids and lean protein.
